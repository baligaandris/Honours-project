You have set up camp along the high road, on your way home after the Orc wars.
You have a good view over your valley, but you still have a good way to go until you are home.

Your childhood best friend Aila is busy setting up the tent, as you light the fire.
You left together for the front lines to defend your home, and now that the peace treaty was signed, you return together.

<<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>
"You know, things will probably be different than you remember. We have been gone for two years."
->"I know."
->"It will still be home"

Aila smiles, and reaches into her rations pack, when something rustles beyond the firelight. A terrifying growling fills the air as you see multiple orange eyes glow in the dark.
"Wolves" Aila whispers, as she slowly picks up her staff, readying for a fight.

->Fight the wolves.
<<CreateCombat CombatHandler 0>>
<<ResolveCombat CombatHandler>>

You are left exhausted and wounded but alive, as the last of the wolves flees your blade, and disappears into the night.
You collapse next to the fire, and tend to each other's wounds. Eventually there isn't much left to do, but get to sleep. You keep you sword handy, just in case.

The next morning is greets you with a bright sun and clear skies. Though still sore from last night's battles, you pack up, and get back on the road.
A few hours into your day's travels, merchant approaches, traveling the road in the other direction.
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 12>>

<<SwapBackgroundAudio BackgroundAudio 9>>
"Hello there! Would you be interested in some of my wares?"

"We could do with some healing potions if you have any." Aila speaks up.

"Certainly, for a mere five gold pieces, it is yours!"

"Oh, we have no money left, unfortunately." Aila answers, diminished.

The merchant seems unarmed, and you outnumber him. You could easily make him give you the potion.

You swiftly draw you sword and point it at him.

"I think you will give it for free this time." You say.
The merchant takes a half step back as his eyes widen, and he slowly raises his hands.

"Oh, eh, certainly! I want no trouble. Here, and my pouch too." He stutters, clearly just wanting to get away.

"How generous. Now get out of here." You point down the road, and he sets off at a remarkable pace down the road.

You apply the potion to your injuries and then hand the bottle over to Aila.
<<SpendMoney Player -5 10 0 0 0>>
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 11>>
She reluctantly takes it.
"Was that necessary?" She asks, clearly upset at your actions.
->"Our need was greater than his. He won't miss the potion, nor the coin."
->"He was being selfish, for not giving us the potion."
->"He is alive and well. No real damage was done."

"I...suppose. Just warn me before you do anything like that again." She says.

<<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>
"You know, we could have taken it from him, by force. We wouldn't need to go on with our injuries"
->"We are soldiers! We can't go breaking the law!"
->"It would have been wrong, to take what isn't ours."
->"We will still recover. If we were dying that would have been different."

"Yeah, you are right, I guess. I just wish this bite wouldn't hurt as much.

About five hours pass and you finally emerge from the woods. Bright sunlight hits you and you squint as a vista of your home town greets you. 
You start riding down the side of the hill, descending among the buildings. You spot some familiar faces, but their expressions are dour and the mood is extremely low. 

The streets seem to be home to many more beggars than when you left two years ago, and the cobblestones are slippery with mud and waste.

There is a sudden explosion of movement in front of you, as the door of a general store slams open, and you see four guards exit, carrying crates and barrels full of food.

A desperate sobbing cry sounds from inside the shop. "Please! You can't take that all! We'll go bankrupt!"
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 6>>
"Duke's orders. You are behind on tax. Out of the way, or you'll get lashes." grumbles the guard, and starts to load the supplies onto a cart.

Aila leans over and whispers in your ear. "Might not want to draw attention to ourselves. Should we interfere?"

You loudly clear you throat and ride forward, to tower over the guards as much as you can.
"Stop!" you shout, and the crowd parts to let you through. "You can't treat these people like this."

The leader of the guards eyes you and Aila spitefully. "Oh yeah? What are you gonna do about it."
-> Try to make a deal
    "You are gonna put them out of business. They can't pay taxes if they have no store, and I'm sure the Duke wouldn't be happy about that. Take half, and leave the rest."
    The guard captain seems to consider for a second, then nods. "Fine. We take half." They load up roughly half of the supplies on the cart, and haul it away without another word.
    <<SwapNPC NPCImage 11>>
    "Thank you!" says the shopkeeper with teary eyes, and sets about collecting what is left of her wares.
    <<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>  
    "It's good you intervened, though I would have loved to kick those guys in the ass. Let's go."
-> Let your sword speak 
    As answer you unsheathe your blade. The guards raise their spears readily.
    <<CreateCombat CombatHandler 1>>
    <<ResolveCombat CombatHandler>>
    Though they give you a few more injuries, your combat skills are far superior and you get the better of them. Soon, you see them running down the street.
    "The Duke will hear about this!" Yells one of them before disappearing through the watching crowd
    <<SwapNPC NPCImage 11>>
    "That was very kind of you, but what if they come back? I'm afraid this isn't over." says the shopkeeper with tears in her eyes, and sets about collecting her wares.   
    <<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>  
    "That was crazy. Are you sure that was a good idea? I'm not sure we solved anything, and now we pissed off the Duke."
    ->"Come what may, it was the just thing to do."
    ->"They deserved a thrashing."
    ->"You might be right. It would have been better to negotiate."
    "Well, what's done is done. Let's go."

You leave the crowd behind. Because your homes are in different parts of the town you wave Aila good bye, and you head towards your childhood home.

You ride out to the fringes of the town, and approach your old home. When you left for the war two years ago, you left your old father and your sister Liessa at home. A few months into the war you received a letter from Liessa that your father passed away. 

As you approach, you consider the house: though it has clearly seen better days, it seems like Liessa has kept up it in good condition. You knock on the door and as it opens Liessa's eye appears in the crack. When she spots you, the doors swings more widely open, and you see her lower a long staff that she was holding as bat, ready to hit someone.
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 13>>
"Ah you are back!" She hugs you happily "I'm so glad! Come in! Sorry for the staff, I get some funny folk out here sometimes."
<<SwapBackground BackgroundImage 9>>
<<SwapBackgroundAudio BackgroundAudio silence>>
You sit down for a dinner and Liessa starts talking about how things have changed during the war.

"The situation is still bad. Though the news of the peace treaty have been affixed the the church doors for a month now, the Duke hasn't released martial law yet."

"They are still taxing us an arm and a leg. They say it's because there is still Orcs around. And of course there are the bandits, attacking anyone and everyone traveling to and from the Capital. They also say monsters have taken over the old graveyard in the forest, so people have to bury their dead in their gardens. While all these dangers are around no-one can argue that the war is truly over."

While she talks she patches up your wounds the best she can. <<SpendMoney Player 0 10 0 0 0>> You share a lunch together, and as she keeps telling you about the hardships of the town, you come a decision. You must help the town return to a normal life. But you need some help with that.

<<SwapBackground BackgroundImage 10>>
As you head out once again you find someone is riding down the road towards you house.

You set off down the forest path, going deeper and deeper into the woods. The trees start to thicker and more dense, almost entirely blocking out the sunlight.

You and your Aila head out of town and start to ride down the Winding Road towards the Capital. The road is aptly named, with it twisting and turning through a forested mountain area.
As you ride on, you hear a rustle of leaves behind you, and a group of rugged looking individuals, carrying bows, crossbows and swords step out behind you. Looking back in front,<<SwapNPC NPCImage 3>> you see that while you were distracted another group jumped out to flank you. One of them steps a bit forward.

"No one move. The toll is five gold pieces. Hand it over, and no-one will get hurt. Refuse and you'll be sent back the way you came with a nasty bruise. Get feisty, and we'll turn you into a pincushion. Am I understood?"

Looking around, you notice one of the bandits in front of you is looking at you rather intensely. As your eyes meet, a shock of recognition runs through you. It's Sil, you used to play together when you were little.

It is a difficult situation. The bandits outnumber you, but you have gotten out of worse spots in the war. And then there is Sil...

As you collect their weapons for proof, Aila voices similar concerns.
"Are you sure this was the right thing to do? Such death, and for what? Some coin taken?"

    She looks around at the other bandits.
    "I'm not exactly in charge here. Listen, if you just pay up, you won't get hurt. We need the money to get by. This isn't exactly our first choice of job either."
->"How did you end up like this?"
    "You know how it is. War starts, prices go up, taxes go up, if you can't keep up you get left behind. We are the ones who were left to fend for ourselves."

One of the bandits speaks up, with a deep raspy voice.

"It's easy for you to speak from your horse, wearing the uniform of the royal army! You will get military pension! We have nothing! We lost our businesses, our homes, everything to the war! We can't afford to start a legitimate business, and people aren't hiring in these uncertain times. Just what are we supposed to do?"

There is a stir of conversation. Your proposal seems to start a back-and-forth discussion. Some are sceptical, others are suspicious. Sil speaks up, and testifies that you are a trustworthy person. Slowly they agree: They will trust you to help them.

A man with a raised sword inches out from behind a tree. He is wearing a suit of armor just like yours.
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>
"Why is a uniformed man hiding in the forest..." she sighs in realization "he's a deserter."
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 4>>
"Aye, I am. We were facing Orcs twice our size and twice as many. I had no intention of dying, so I ran. I never wanted to fight."

Despite his protests, you bind him and gag him with a rope and heave him up on the back of your horse.

You ride back to town, and take him to a guard.
"Well, well, well, what do we have here? A deserter? There is no bounty on them, but the Duke thanks you for your service." 
<<SwapBackground BackgroundImage 7>>
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 11>>
"Well, I doubt that he was the "monster" that everyone fears so much, so we should go back to the forest, I recon."

As you ride back to the forest, Aila speaks up again.
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>
"So, tell me, why did you turn him in? Does he deserve this fate? Can you honestly say you wouldn't have done that in his place? We never had a battle that one-sided."

"Well, I doubt that he was the "monster" that everyone fears so much, so we should go on, I recon."
"Let me ask, why did you let him go? Didn't he betray soldiers just like us? Should he not be punished?"

After an hour of riding you approach the cave's mouth. The rays of the sun only penetrate a few meters into the echo-y depths, beyond which it's just darkness, and the sound of dripping water.

As you wander in, you see hulking shapes emerge from the shadows. You have seen enough of them to know: They are orcs. They wear makeshift armour pieced together from animalskins, and dented pieces of metal plating. 

They seem to eye you from a distance, as they ready axes and huge blades.

One that seems like a leader, wearing lots of bone-jewelry. addresses you in broken human tounge.

Huge muscled orcs rush out of the darkness, waving enormous weapons. You have fought their kind many times, and know the right tactics against them.
Unfortunately you are outnumbered. This will be a grueling fight.
<<CreateCombat CombatHandler 4>>
<<ResolveCombat CombatHandler>>
They nearly beat you, but you manage to just barely win. You collapse to the ground, under your many injuries. You take long to leave the cave, limping and hurt.
As Aila helps you stumble down the rocky path she turns to you.
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>
"I hoped the war was over, but I suppose it never really ends, does it? I just keep thinking there could have been another way to deal with this.
Should we not have negotiated? After all, they let the miner go, maybe they could have been reasoned with! 

Even the law says all orc soldier left in the kingdom should be prisoners of war, and returned in exchange for our soldiers."

[[ "Their kind killed many of my friends on the front lines." | Sure ]]

The increasing murmurings of the orc troops in the darkness dies down in a second. The Chief steps closer, disbelief etched into his face.

"The war, over? Why should we believe you, human? This is probably a trick. A ruse, to get away and bring your armies down on us."

"I'm not lying. Look, I was a soldier of the Royal military" you point at the insignia on your chest "The war has ended two months ago. You must have been separated from your people longer than that to not have heard the news. It would also explain why you haven't seen more Orc forces around. You can go home."

"There is some sense in what you speak, human. We have been separated from the horde for three moons. You bring us proof of the peace, and we leave. You don't, and we take the town in the valley for the horde."

<<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>
"That should be easy, the town hall has multiple copies of the peace notice nailed to its door. We can bring one. Can you read the human writing?"
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 8>>
"Yes, I can. Bring the proof. Now leave."
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 11>>
You leave the cave, the large group of orcs parting to let you pass. This would have been an awful fight.
As you step outside Aila whispers to you.
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>
"So, do we actually get them the notice? We might as well call the town guards, just to make sure. You can never trust an Orc, can you?"

You hightail it towards the cave's mouth, dodging between swinging weapons, and stumbling on large rocks. You get to the opening and dashing out into the open air. You hop on your horses and ride off towards the village. 
<<SpendMoney Player 0 -20 0 0 0>>
As you get further away, you can slow to a less desperate pace, and take note of your injuries. You have suffered several small wounds, but it seems like you have avoided bigger injuries by escaping rather than fight.

"Back to the cave then."
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 8>>
<<SwapBackground BackgroundImage 3>>
<<SwapBackgroundAudio BackgroundAudio 14>>
An hour later you arrive near the cave. As you enter, you notice the Orcs are in a stir, getting ready for something. A journey? A battle?
They notice you and stop their activities looking at you expectantly. The Chief steps up to you, and takes the scroll from your hands.

"The human speaks the truth. The war has ended. We must return home." He says, his voice echoing in the deep chambers of the cave.
The Orcs break out in cheers. I twitch from the sudden explosion of sound, but when you realize they are voices of celebration you understand: They hated the war just as much as you did. They are simply happy to return home.

<<SwapNPC NPCImage 11>>
You take your leave while they celebrate.
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>
As you leave the cave, Aila whispers to you.
"Never thought I'd see an orc celebrate the end of a war. Still, they were our enemies not so long ago. I'm sure they killed many humans and elves. Should we not have fought them? Gotten revenge?"

[[ "They were no longer our enemies" | Sure ]]

You ride back into town at a haste. You must rally the guards to protect the town!
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 6>>
"Orcs? Are you sure? I'll alert the guard captain."
The guard dashes off, and soon you see dozens and dozens more stream out of the castle. They are rushing about in a bit of a panic, and you can see the guard captain shouting orders.
"Stop pissing your pants you fool! We can take them! Yes, Orc blood will flow thick and fast tonight."
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>
"Something tells me they aren't planning to take the Orcs captive. According to the treaty, they must be treated as prisoners of war, and taken to the border to exchange.

"You adventurers are a pain in my ass. Fine, the law is the law. We'll take manacles, and arrest them if we can."
They leave the town towards the cave.
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 11>>
In a few hours you see the guards return with orcs in chains being lead into town, loaded onto carriges, and taken away towards the northern borders.
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 6>>
"There you go, prisoners of war. I hope you are happy. Take your reward. I had to take some out to pay for all effort of transporting them. It is still a good sum.

<<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>
"This could have gone a lot worse, I suppose. But was this the best option? They have probably killed many of our countrymen, and would have done the same to us without a second thought. I'm sure we could have taken them.

Or maybe we should have just let them go? What was the point of getting them captured? They could have gone home on their own."

<<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>
Aila starts to read out the notice.
"'Let it be known that His Royal Majesty the Queen has agreed to a peace with the Orc Chieftain...' bla bla bla. Lots of waffle. Ah, look 'All captured orc soldiers to be treated as prisoners of war, and be returned to the border to be exchanged for soldiers of the Royal military' hopefully that means things will soon get back to normal."

The power of the Duke's magic is overwhelming. It takes every bit of your resolve and strength to overcome him. The guards all flee from the destruction.
