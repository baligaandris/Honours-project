You have set up camp along the high road, on your way home after the Orc wars.
You have a good view over your valley, but you still have a good way to go until you are home.

Your childhood best friend Aila is busy setting up the tent, as you light the fire.
You left together for the front lines to defend your home, and now that the peace treaty was signed, you return together.

<<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>
"You know, things will probably be different than you remember. We have been gone for two years."
->"I know."
->"It will still be home"

Aila smiles, and reaches into her rations pack, when something rustles beyond the firelight. A terrifying growling fills the air as you see multiple orange eyes glow in the dark.
"Wolves" Aila whispers, as she slowly picks up her staff, readying for a fight.

->Fight the wolves.
<<CreateCombat CombatHandler 0>>
<<ResolveCombat CombatHandler>>

You are left exhausted and wounded but alive, as the last of the wolves flees your blade, and disappears into the night.
You collapse next to the fire, and tend to each other's wounds. Eventually there isn't much left to do, but get to sleep. You keep you sword handy, just in case.

The next morning is greets you with a bright sun and clear skies. Though still sore from last night's battles, you pack up, and get back on the road.
A few hours into your day's travels, merchant approaches, traveling the road in the other direction.
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 12>>
<<SwapBackground BackgroundImage 11>>
<<SwapBackgroundAudio BackgroundAudio 9>>
"Hello there! Would you be interested in some of my wares?"

"We could do with some healing potions if you have any." Aila speaks up.

"Certainly, for a mere five gold pieces, it is yours!"

"Oh, we have no money left, unfortunately." Aila answers, diminished.

The merchant seems unarmed, and you outnumber him. You could easily make him give you the potion.

You swiftly draw you sword and point it at him.

"I think you will give it for free this time." You say.
The merchant takes a half step back as his eyes widen, and he slowly raises his hands.

"Oh, eh, certainly! I want no trouble. Here, and my pouch too." He stutters, clearly just wanting to get away.

"How generous. Now get out of here." You point down the road, and he sets off at a remarkable pace down the road.

You apply the potion to your injuries and then hand the bottle over to Aila.
<<SpendMoney Player -5 10 0 0 0>>
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 11>>
She reluctantly takes it.
"Was that necessary?" She asks, clearly upset at your actions.
->"Our need was greater than his. He won't miss the potion, nor the coin."
->"He was being selfish, for not giving us the potion."
->"He is alive and well. No real damage was done."

"I...suppose. Just warn me before you do anything like that again." She says.

<<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>
"You know, we could have taken it from him, by force. We wouldn't need to go on with our injuries"
->"We are soldiers! We can't go breaking the law!"
->"It would have been wrong, to take what isn't ours."
->"We will still recover. If we were dying that would have been different."

"Yeah, you are right, I guess. I just wish this bite wouldn't hurt as much.

About five hours pass and you finally emerge from the woods. Bright sunlight hits you and you squint as a vista of your home town greets you. 
You start riding down the side of the hill, descending among the buildings. You spot some familiar faces, but their expressions are dour and the mood is extremely low. 

The streets seem to be home to many more beggars than when you left two years ago, and the cobblestones are slippery with mud and waste.

There is a sudden explosion of movement in front of you, as the door of a general store slams open, and you see four guards exit, carrying crates and barrels full of food.

A desperate sobbing cry sounds from inside the shop. "Please! You can't take that all! We'll go bankrupt!"
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 6>>
"Duke's orders. You are behind on tax. Out of the way, or you'll get lashes." grumbles the guard, and starts to load the supplies onto a cart.

Aila leans over and whispers in your ear. "Might not want to draw attention to ourselves. Should we interfere?"

You loudly clear you throat and ride forward, to tower over the guards as much as you can.
"Stop!" you shout, and the crowd parts to let you through. "You can't treat these people like this."

The leader of the guards eyes you and Aila spitefully. "Oh yeah? What are you gonna do about it."
-> Try to make a deal
    "You are gonna put them out of business. They can't pay taxes if they have no store, and I'm sure the Duke wouldn't be happy about that. Take half, and leave the rest."
    The guard captain seems to consider for a second, then nods. "Fine. We take half." They load up roughly half of the supplies on the cart, and haul it away without another word.
    <<SwapNPC NPCImage 11>>
    "Thank you!" says the shopkeeper with teary eyes, and sets about collecting what is left of her wares.
    <<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>  
    "It's good you intervened, though I would have loved to kick those guys in the ass. Let's go."
-> Let your sword speak 
    As answer you unsheathe your blade. The guards raise their spears readily.
    <<CreateCombat CombatHandler 1>>
    <<ResolveCombat CombatHandler>>
    Though they give you a few more injuries, your combat skills are far superior and you get the better of them. Soon, you see them running down the street.
    "The Duke will hear about this!" Yells one of them before disappearing through the watching crowd
    <<SwapNPC NPCImage 11>>
    "That was very kind of you, but what if they come back? I'm afraid this isn't over." says the shopkeeper with tears in her eyes, and sets about collecting her wares.   
    <<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>  
    "That was crazy. Are you sure that was a good idea? I'm not sure we solved anything, and now we pissed off the Duke."
    ->"Come what may, it was the just thing to do."
    ->"They deserved a thrashing."
    ->"You might be right. It would have been better to negotiate."
    "Well, what's done is done. Let's go."

You leave the crowd behind. Because your homes are in different parts of the town you wave Aila good bye, and you head towards your childhood home.

You ride out to the fringes of the town, and approach your old home. When you left for the war two years ago, you left your old father and your sister Liessa at home. A few months into the war you received a letter from Liessa that your father passed away. 

As you approach, you consider the house: though it has clearly seen better days, it seems like Liessa has kept up it in good condition. You knock on the door and as it opens Liessa's eye appears in the crack. When she spots you, the doors swings more widely open, and you see her lower a long staff that she was holding as bat, ready to hit someone.
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 13>>
"Ah you are back!" She hugs you happily "I'm so glad! Come in! Sorry for the staff, I get some funny folk out here sometimes."
<<SwapBackground BackgroundImage 9>>
<<SwapBackgroundAudio BackgroundAudio silence>>
You sit down for a dinner and Liessa starts talking about how things have changed during the war.

"The situation is still bad. Though the news of the peace treaty have been affixed the the church doors for a month now, the Duke hasn't released martial law yet."

"They are still taxing us an arm and a leg. They say it's because there is still Orcs around. And of course there are the bandits, attacking anyone and everyone traveling to and from the Capital. They also say monsters have taken over the old graveyard in the forest, so people have to bury their dead in their gardens. While all these dangers are around no-one can argue that the war is truly over."

While she talks she patches up your wounds the best she can. <<SpendMoney Player 0 10 0 0 0>> You share a lunch together, and as she keeps telling you about the hardships of the town, you come a decision. You must help the town return to a normal life. But you need some help with that.

As you head out once again you find someone is riding down the road towards you house.

You and your Aila head out of town and start to ride down the Winding Road towards the Capital. The road is aptly named, with it twisting and turning through a forested mountain area.
As you ride on, you hear a rustle of leaves behind you, and a group of rugged looking individuals, carrying bows, crossbows and swords step out behind you. Looking back in front,<<SwapNPC NPCImage 3>> you see that while you were distracted another group jumped out to flank you. One of them steps a bit forward.

"No one move. The toll is five gold pieces. Hand it over, and no-one will get hurt. Refuse and you'll be sent back the way you came with a nasty bruise. Get feisty, and we'll turn you into a pincushion. Am I understood?"

Looking around, you notice one of the bandits in front of you is looking at you rather intensely. As your eyes meet, a shock of recognition runs through you. It's Gref, you used to play together when you were little.

It is a difficult situation. The bandits outnumber you, but you have gotten out of worse spots in the war. And then there is Gref...

The cave has thermal water-pools in it, and so the mouth of it is usually releasing copious amounts of steam. The inside is hot, and your vision is limited by the steam in the air.

As you wander in, you see hulking shapes emerge from the mist. Armed and armored orcs, wielding heavy axes and hammers.

They seem wary of you, and one of the biggest ones speaks up:
<<SwapNPC NPCImage 8>>

You let the guards know that you found an enemy unit nearby.
You hear the head of the guard dispatches a unit to deal with them. It seems like they want to kill them.

Your friend whispers to you that under the treaty, they should just be shipped back to their home country.

[[ Stand up to the guard, and tell them that they mustn't kill the orcs. | GuardsDeportOrcs ]]

Soon, you see the orcs in chains being lead into town, loaded onto carriges, and taken away. The guard captain confirms they are prisoners of war, and will be taken to border to be released into their country.

Your friend questions your decision. Should we not have killed them? They have probably killed many of our countrymen, and would have done the same to us without thinking.
Or maybe we should have just let them go? What was the point of getting them captured? They could have gone home on their own.

[[ This was the safest option. No-one got hurt. | Sure ]]
[[ We can't trust them, but bloodshed was not necessary.| Sure ]] 
[[ We followed the laws set by the peace treaty, which is the most important. | Sure ]]

The guards return bloodied a few hours later. They have undoubtedly killed the orcs. Some of them sport bad injuries, and they have two dead with them.

You are rewarded for your service. You get a pat on the shoulder for being a true patriot.

Your friends question your decision:
Was this necessary? Could this have been resolved without anyone getting hurt? We broke the law set up by the peace treaty! 

[[ The guards did it, not us, it is not our responsibility. | Sure ]] 
[[ They were a treat and had to be removed. | Sure ]] 
[[ Their kind killed a lot of our friends, they had it coming. | Sure ]]
