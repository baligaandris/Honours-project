It's raining like hell, and there is still a ways to go, so you set up camp.
In the camp you have a chance to talk to your friend, to establish backgrounds
Some wolves attack, You fight them. Go to sleep.

The village is different than you remember. Things are in worse condition, people seem downtrodden and weak.
There is an explosion of movement out of a nearby store with a group of armed and armored town guards dragging out crates full of goods.

You and your friend decide to split up, and each of you can go home.

At home you have a conversation with your family who tell you about the monsters, bandits, and enemy forces in the area, and how the lord controls the town with an iron fist.

You decide to deal with the problems in the town,

You propose this: They surrender their weapons to you. You take it all back to town and collect the bounty on their heads. Return with the money and give it to them, so they can start a new life.

They initially don't like it, but your old friend speaks up for you, and they agree.
You take a trip back to the village, get the money and return. The bandits thank you for your generous help and leave towards the city.

Your friend questions your decision: Can they be trusted? What if they fall back on their old habits? Won't you be responsible for their future crimes? Shouldn't they be punished for their crimes?

You ready your weapon, and hop off your horse. You approach the brush slowly expecting the monster to jump out. You signal to your partner to go flank from the other side. On a silent count to three you both charge to surprise the skulker.

You manage to pin down the man, who turns out to be a deserter.

So you ride back to the forest.

The cave has thermal water-pools in it, and so the mouth of it is usually releasing copious amounts of steam. The inside is hot, and your vision is limited by the steam in the air.

As you wander in, you see hulking shapes emerge from the mist. Armed and armored orcs, wielding heavy axes and hammers.

They seem wary of you, and one of the biggest ones speaks up:

"We have no quarrel with you, human, but we can't allow you to bring your armies down upon us. You must die."

After all, our countries are in peace now.

"woah, woah, woah! Let's not get ahead of ourselves. We aren't here to fight you, or to bring armies down upon you. The war is over."

The orcs didn't know the war has ended, they have been separated from their unit, and had no line of communication to their leaders. They require proof. There is an official notice posted on the door of the church in town. You can go get it.

You hightail it towards the door, dodging between swinging weapons, and disappearing through the mist. You get to the cave's mouth and dashing out into the open air. You hop on your horses and ride off towards the village. You have several bleeding wounds.

You arrive back in town, with only one idea, of what to do.

You take a trip back to the town, collect the notice of the door, and deliver it to the Orcs. They realize they can return home, and do so.

Your friend questions your decision?
Should we not have killed them? They have probably killed many of our countrymen, and would have done the same to us without thinking. Don't we owe this to our fallen, and our nation to hunt down our enemies?

[[ They were no longer our enemies | Sure ]] 
[[ It wasn't our war, but our leaders'. The common soldiers are just tools. | Sure ]]

You let the guards know that you found an enemy unit nearby.
You hear the head of the guard dispatches a unit to deal with them. It seems like they want to kill them. Your friend whispers to you that under the treaty, they should just be shipped back to their home country.

Soon, you see the orcs in chains being lead into town, loaded onto carriges, and taken away. The guard captain confirms they are prisoners of war, and will be taken to border to be released into their country.

Your friend questions your decision. Should we not have killed them? They have probably killed many of our countrymen, and would have done the same to us without thinking.
Or maybe we should have just let them go? What was the point of getting them captured? They could have gone home on their own.

[[ This was the safest option. No-one got hurt. | Sure ]]
