As the sun approaches the horizon you decide to set up camp one more time before approaching the bandit-controlled valley. You signal to your companion to approach the roadside clearing nearby and direct your horse similarly. 

You dismount and tie the lead to low branch. While setting up the campsite you and your companion discuss the plan for tomorrow.

[[ Leave the horses and sneak into the valley. | Stealth ]] 
[[ Ride in on horseback, Out in the open. | Ride ]]
