You have set up camp along the high road, on your way home after the Orc wars.
You have a good view over your valley, but you still have a good way to go until you are home.

Your childhood best friend Aila is busy setting up the tent, as you light the fire.
You left together for the front lines to defend your home, and now that the peace treaty was signed, you return together.

<<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>
"You know, things will probably be different than you remember. We have been gone for two years."
->"I know."
->"It will still be home"

Aila smiles, and reaches into her rations pack, when something rustles beyond the firelight. A terrifying growling fills the air as you see multiple orange eyes glow in the dark.
"Wolves" Aila whispers, as she slowly picks up her staff, readying for a fight.

->Fight the wolves.
<<CreateCombat CombatHandler 0>>
<<ResolveCombat CombatHandler>>

You are left exhausted and wounded but alive, as the last of the wolves flees your blade, and disappears into the night.
You collapse next to the fire, and tend to each other's wounds. Eventually there isn't much left to do, but get to sleep. You keep you sword handy, just in case.

The next morning is greets you with a bright sun and clear skies. Though still sore from last night's battles, you pack up, and get back on the road.
A few hours into your day's travels, merchant approaches, traveling the road in the other direction.

"Hello there! Would you be interested in some of my wares?"

"We could do with some healing potions if you have any." Aila speaks up.

"Certainly, for a mere five gold pieces, it is yours!"

"Oh, we have no money left, unfortunately." Aila answers, diminished.

The merchant seems unarmed, and you outnumber him. You could easily make him give you the potion.

"I think you will give it for free this time." You say.
The merchant takes a half step back as his eyes widen, and he slowly raises his hands.

"Oh, eh, certainly! I want no trouble. Here, and my pouch too." He stutters, clearly just wanting to get away.

"How generous. Now get out of here." You point down the road, and he sets off at a remarkable pace down the road.

You apply the potion to your injuries and then hand the bottle over to Aila.

<<SwapNPC NPCImage 11>>
She reluctantly takes it.
"Was that necessary?" She asks, clearly upset at your actions.
->"Our need was greater than his. He won't miss the potion, nor the coin."
->"He was being selfish, for not giving us the potion."
->"He is alive and well. No real damage was done."

"I...suppose. Just warn me before you do anything like that again." She says.

<<SwapNPC NPCImage 14>>
"You know, we could have taken it from him, by force. We wouldn't need to go on with our injuries"
->"We are soldiers! We can't go breaking the law!"
->"It would have been wrong, to take what isn't ours."
->"We will still recover. If we were dying that would have been different."

"Yeah, you are right, I guess. I just wish this bite wouldn't hurt as much.
